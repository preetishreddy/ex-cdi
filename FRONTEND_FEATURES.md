## 1. Login Page

**File**: `frontend/login.html`  
**Route**: `/` (dev server rewrites to `login.html`)  
**Styles**: Inline `<style>` tag  
**Scripts**: Inline `<script>` tag  

### What It Is
The entry point of the application — a sign-in form where users authenticate with email and password.

### Why It's Used
Acts as the authentication gate. All other pages check `sessionStorage.isLoggedIn` and redirect here if the user hasn't authenticated.

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Email & Password Fields** | Standard form inputs with validation (email must contain `@`, password ≥ 1 char) |
| **Password Visibility Toggle** | Eye icon toggles between `password` and `text` input types |
| **Remember Me Checkbox** | UI checkbox (visual only, not persisted to backend) |
| **Forgot Password Link** | Navigates to `forgot_password.html` |
| **Register Link** | Navigates to `register.html` |
| **Animated Background** | Full-page `bg.jpg` with an animated radial glow effect |
| **Session Storage Auth** | On submit: stores `isLoggedIn`, `userEmail`, `userName`, `jiraDomain` in `sessionStorage`, then redirects to `project_dashboard.html` |

### API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | — | Client-side only; no backend auth verification |

---

## 2. Register Page

**File**: `frontend/register.html`  
**Route**: `/register`  
**Styles**: `static/css/auth.css`  
**Scripts**: `static/js/auth.js` + inline `<script>`  

### What It Is
An account creation form that collects user details and registers them as an employee in the system.

### Why It's Used
Onboards new team members into the platform by creating their employee record in the database, which subsequently appears in project dashboards, member chips, and team listings.

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Full Name Input** | Collects the user's display name |
| **Email Input** | Email address with `@` validation |
| **Role Dropdown** | 12 roles: Engineering Manager, Software Engineer, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Full Stack Developer, DevOps Engineer, QA Engineer, UI/UX Designer, Product Manager, Data Analyst, Scrum Master, Technical Lead |
| **Department Dropdown** | 9 departments: Engineering, Product, Design, QA, Data, DevOps, Management, Security, Research |
| **Password with Strength Meter** | Visual bar that checks: length ≥ 8, uppercase, lowercase, number, bonus at ≥ 12 chars. Colors: red → orange → yellow → green |
| **Confirm Password** | Must match password field |
| **Backend Registration** | Sends `POST /api/register/` to create employee record |

### API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Body | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/register/` | POST | `{name, email, role, department}` | Creates an employee in the knowledge base |

---

## 3. Forgot Password Page

**File**: `frontend/forgot_password.html`  
**Route**: `/forgot_password`  
**Styles**: `static/css/auth.css`  
**Scripts**: `static/js/auth.js`  

### What It Is
A simple password reset request form.

### Why It's Used
Allows users who have forgotten their password to request a reset link via email.

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Back to Login Link** | Returns to `login.html` |
| **Lock Icon** | Visual indicator of the page purpose |
| **Email Input** | Collects the user's email address |
| **Submit Button** | Client-side validation only (no backend reset flow implemented) |

### API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | — | Reset flow not connected to backend |

---

## 4. Project Dashboard Page (Main Application)

**File**: `frontend/project_dashboard.html`  
**Route**: `/project_overview` (also `/project_overview?page=integrations`)  
**Styles**: `project_dashboard.css` (~2300 lines), `integrations.css` (~700 lines), `solution_chat.css` (~700 lines)  
**Scripts**: `project_dashboard.js` (~2100 lines, ES module), `solution_chat.js` (~690 lines)  

### What It Is
The primary hub of the application — a rich project overview dashboard that aggregates sprints, decisions, tickets, meetings, and integrations into a single view.

### Why It's Used
Gives team members a comprehensive, real-time view of their project's state — what was decided, who's working on what, how sprints are progressing, and what happened in meetings. This is the page users land on after login.

### What It Is
A persistent AI assistant panel that slides out from the right side of the screen, powered by the OnboardingChatbot backend via GPT-4o (Bytez API).

### Features

| Feature | Description |

| **Message Editing** | Click the edit icon on any user message to re-send it (removes all subsequent messages) |
| **Chat History** | Stored in `localStorage` (max 20 chats). Previous chats accessible via history drawer |
| **New Chat** | Creates a fresh conversation with a new `conversation_id` |
| **Keyboard Shortcuts** | `Ctrl+L` toggle, `Escape` close, `Enter` send, `Shift+Enter` new line |
| **Multi-turn Memory** | Backend maintains conversation context via `conversation_id` — the bot resolves references like "it" or "that decision" across turns |

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Body | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/chat/` | POST | `{query, conversation_id}` | Send natural-language query to AI chatbot |

### Response Format
```json
{
  "answer": "Markdown-formatted response text...",
